1. Purpose & Objectives
Hero MotoCorp is one of the world’s largest two-wheeler manufacturers.
The supply chain involves raw material procurement, vendor management, parts manufacturing, assembly, distribution, and dealer sales.
Your Python + SQL system should help:
1) Optimize parts supply from multiple vendors. 
2) Track production progress across plants.
3) Monitor inventory at different stages (raw, WIP, finished).
4) Streamline logistics for nationwide dealer distribution. 
5) Generate analytics for forecasting and decision-making.

2. Hero MotoCorp Supply Chain Stages
We can structure the system to reflect five key stages:

1. Procurement
Vendors supply steel, tires, electronics, plastics, etc. And add parts and their details. 
Data tracked: Vendor details, part specifications, lead times, quality ratings.
Features:
- Vendor onboarding & rating system.
- Purchase Order management.
- Supplier performance tracking.

2. Inbound Logistics
Tracking shipments from suppliers to manufacturing plants. Add new suppliers.
Real-time updates on ETA, delays, and shortages.
Warehouse space allocation.

3. Manufacturing
Plants assemble motorcycles in stages:
Engine assembly
Chassis & frame building
Painting & finishing
Final assembly & inspection
System should:
Track Work-In-Progress (WIP) by stage.
Monitor machine utilization & downtime.
Alert if parts shortage halts production.

4. Outbound Logistics
Finished bikes shipped to regional warehouses & dealers.

Track dispatch dates, transit time, and delivery confirmation.

5. Dealers & Sales
Dealer network across India.

Monitor:

Dealer orders & allocations.

Stock at each dealership.

Sales trends by model & location.

3. System Modules
The Python + SQL application should be split into:

A. Master Data Management
Vendors (name, location, rating, part types supplied)

Products (models, variants, parts list, BOM - Bill of Materials)

Plants (location, capacity, shift details)

Dealers (location, capacity, sales history)

B. Procurement Module
Create & track Purchase Orders (POs).

Auto-reorder based on production forecast.

Supplier delivery performance analysis.

C. Production Planning Module
Manage BOM for each model.

Allocate parts to assembly lines.

Track WIP by stage.

Generate daily production reports.

D. Logistics Module
Inbound tracking from supplier to plant.

Outbound tracking from plant to dealer.

Route optimization (future enhancement with Google Maps API).

E. Inventory Management
Raw Material stock.

WIP inventory.

Finished Goods stock.

Reorder level alerts.

F. Reporting & Analytics
Low-stock alerts.

Supplier on-time delivery rate.

Production vs. demand analysis.

Sales trends by region.

Monthly plant performance.

4. Database Structure (SQL)
Example tables:

sql

Edit
-- Suppliers
CREATE TABLE suppliers (
    supplier_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    location TEXT,
    rating INTEGER,
    lead_time_days INTEGER
);

-- Parts
CREATE TABLE parts (
    part_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    category TEXT,
    unit_price REAL,
    stock_level INTEGER,
    reorder_level INTEGER,
    supplier_id INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY(supplier_id) REFERENCES suppliers(supplier_id)
);

-- BOM (Bill of Materials)
CREATE TABLE bom (
    model_id INTEGER,
    part_id INTEGER,
    quantity_required INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (model_id, part_id)
);

-- Production Status
CREATE TABLE production (
    production_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    model_id INTEGER,
    stage TEXT,
    status TEXT,
    quantity INTEGER,
    date DATE
);

  8. Exit
Example Actions:

Vendor Management: Add/edit vendors, assign parts.

Inventory: Check current stock, trigger PO if below reorder level.

Production: Allocate parts, track assembly stage.

Logistics: Update shipment status.

Reports: Supplier performance, production output, sales by region.

6. Suggested Tech Stack
Backend: Python 3.x

Database: MySQL (multi-user, large data handling)

Libraries:

mysql.connector → DB connection

pandas → analytics & reports

matplotlib → production/sales graphs

tkinter → GUI (optional for better UX)

7. Future Expansion Ideas
IoT integration for live machine status.

AI demand forecasting using historical sales.

QR/barcode tracking for parts.

Dealer portal for real-time stock requests.
